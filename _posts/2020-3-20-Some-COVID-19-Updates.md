## Important Announcement

Some time ago we announced that we will be presenting [Eight Hours](https://eighthoursgame.com) at the [2020 Midwest Gaming Classic (MGC2020)](https://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/). Due to the pandemic of COVID-19, MGC2020 has been cancelled. Thus we will not be able to demo Eight Hours at the event.

We would like to thank MGC2020 and the Wisconsin Games Alliance for working with us before these events. We would also like to notify all of the players interested in Eight Hours that the demo is available for download at the following sites:

- [itch.io](https://trollpurse.itch.io/eighthours)
- [Gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/eighthours/237778)
- [IndieDB](https://www.indiedb.com/games/eight-hours)

Feel free to download our latest demo and send us some feedback!
